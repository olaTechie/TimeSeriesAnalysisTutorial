# üìä Time Series Analysis for Public Health - Interactive Presentation

An interactive, self-contained HTML presentation of a workshop on Time Series Analysis. This presentation uses a case study focused on the relationship between air pollution (PM2.5) and Tuberculosis (TB) in Kampala, Uganda, to demonstrate a complete data analysis workflow from initial analysis to policy simulation and recommendation.

## üìù Key Topics Covered

The presentation walks through the essential methods and applications of modern time series analysis in the public health sector, including:

- **Context Setting**: Understanding the public health challenge in Kampala concerning air quality and TB.
- **Interrupted Time Series (ITS) Analysis**: A quasi-experimental design to evaluate the impact of interventions.
- **Seasonality & Decomposition**: Methods for understanding and handling cyclical patterns in health data.
- **Time Series Feature Engineering**: Creating derived variables like lags, calendar effects, and rolling statistics to improve model performance.
- **Forecasting Essentials**: A review of forecasting approaches from naive and statistical methods (ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing) to machine learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost).
- **Model Evaluation & Interpretation**: Using metrics like MAE/RMSE and explainability techniques like SHAP and LIME to understand model behavior.
- **Policy Intervention Simulation**: Using models to forecast the potential health and economic impacts of different policy scenarios.

## ‚ú® Features

This presentation is a single, portable file with several modern features:

- **Fully Self-Contained**: All styling and scripts are embedded in the HTML file. No dependencies or internet connection required to view.
